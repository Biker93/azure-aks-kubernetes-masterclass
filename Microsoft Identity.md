https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant
When you create a new Azure AD tenant, you become the first user of that tenant. As the first user, you're automatically assigned the Global Admin role.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access
Ensure your directory has at least two accounts with global administrator privileges assigned to them. This will help in the case that one global administrator is locked out.
